# üîÑ Real-Time Marketplace Synchronization

## Overview

This implementation enables real-time synchronization between the ServiceTextPro mobile app user settings and the Marketplace "–ù–∞–º–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏ —É—Å–ª—É–≥–∏" tab. When service providers update their profile information in the mobile app, the changes are immediately reflected in the Marketplace without requiring page refreshes.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Components

1. **Mobile App** (`ServiceTextPro/src/screens/ProviderProfileScreen.tsx`)
   - Service providers fill out their profile
   - Data is sent to backend via API

2. **Backend API** (`ServiceTextPro/backend/src/controllers/MarketplaceController.ts`)
   - Receives profile updates from mobile app
   - Updates database
   - Broadcasts real-time events via WebSocket

3. **Marketplace Frontend** (`Marketplace/src/app/search/page.tsx`)
   - Displays service providers
   - Listens for real-time updates via WebSocket
   - Updates UI instantly when profiles change

4. **WebSocket Service** (`Marketplace/src/lib/socket.ts`)
   - Manages real-time communication
   - Handles connection management and reconnection
   - Provides room-based subscriptions for efficient updates

## üöÄ Features

### Real-Time Updates
- ‚úÖ Instant profile updates when SPs modify their information
- ‚úÖ Location-based filtering (only relevant updates shown)
- ‚úÖ Category-based filtering (only relevant categories)
- ‚úÖ Visual indicators for connection status and update count
- ‚úÖ Automatic reconnection on connection loss

### Smart Filtering
- Updates are only shown to users viewing relevant search results
- Location-based rooms: `location-–°–æ—Ñ–∏—è`, `location-–°–æ—Ñ–∏—è-–¶–µ–Ω—Ç—ä—Ä`
- Category-based rooms: `category-electrician`, `category-plumber`
- Global updates for all marketplace viewers

### GDPR Compliance
- All real-time updates respect existing GDPR consent settings
- Data is only transmitted to authorized clients
- Audit logging for all real-time events

## üì± Mobile App Integration

### Profile Data Structure
```typescript
interface ProviderProfile {
  businessName: string
  serviceCategory: string
  description: string
  experienceYears: number
  hourlyRate: number
  city: string
  neighborhood: string
  phoneNumber: string
  email: string
  profileImageUrl: string
  gallery: string[]
  certificates: Array<{title: string}>
}
```

### API Endpoint
- **POST** `/api/v1/marketplace/providers/profile`
- Updates provider profile and triggers real-time broadcast
- Returns updated provider data

## üåê Marketplace Integration

### WebSocket Events
- `provider_profile_updated` - Global profile updates
- Connection status monitoring
- Automatic room management based on search filters

### Visual Indicators
- üü¢ Green dot: Connected to real-time updates
- üî¥ Red dot: Disconnected
- Blue badge: Number of real-time updates received

### Real-Time UI Updates
- Existing providers are updated in-place
- New providers matching search filters are added automatically
- Smooth transitions and visual feedback

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Enhanced MarketplaceController
```typescript
// Real-time broadcasting after profile updates
const io = (req as any).io;
io.emit('provider_profile_updated', updateData);
io.to(`location-${city}`).emit('provider_profile_updated', updateData);
io.to(`category-${category}`).emit('provider_profile_updated', updateData);
```

#### 2. WebSocket Room Management
```typescript
// Location-based rooms
socket.on('join_location_room', (locationName) => {
  socket.join(`location-${locationName}`);
});

// Category-based rooms  
socket.on('join_category_room', (category) => {
  socket.join(`category-${category}`);
});
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. WebSocket Service
- Connection management with auto-reconnection
- Room-based subscriptions
- Event handling and cleanup

#### 2. Search Page Updates
- Real-time event listeners
- State management for live updates
- Visual feedback and status indicators

## üß™ Testing

### Test Script
Use the provided test script to simulate profile updates:

```bash
# Basic test
node test-realtime-sync.js

# Multiple rapid updates
node test-realtime-sync.js --multiple

# Location change test
node test-realtime-sync.js --location
```

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Setup**
   ```bash
   # Start backend server
   cd ServiceTextPro/backend
   npm start
   
   # Start marketplace
   cd Marketplace
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Real-Time Updates**
   - Open Marketplace: `http://localhost:3000/search`
   - Open browser developer console
   - Run test script to simulate mobile app updates
   - Watch for real-time updates in the UI

3. **Test Filtering**
   - Search for specific category/location in Marketplace
   - Update provider profile with matching criteria
   - Verify update appears immediately
   - Update provider with non-matching criteria
   - Verify update doesn't appear

## üìä Performance Considerations

### Efficient Updates
- Room-based broadcasting reduces unnecessary network traffic
- Only relevant clients receive updates
- Debounced updates prevent spam

### Connection Management
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Connection status monitoring
- Graceful degradation when offline

### Memory Management
- Event listener cleanup on component unmount
- Efficient state updates using React hooks
- Minimal re-renders through smart filtering

## üîí Security & GDPR

### Data Privacy
- Only authorized profile data is broadcast
- GDPR consent validation for real-time features
- Audit logging for compliance

### Connection Security
- WebSocket connections respect CORS policies
- Authentication tokens for sensitive operations
- Rate limiting on WebSocket events

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Failed**
   - Check backend server is running
   - Verify API_URL configuration
   - Check firewall/network settings

2. **Updates Not Appearing**
   - Verify WebSocket connection status (green dot)
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Ensure search filters match updated provider

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor connection count in backend logs
   - Check for memory leaks in browser dev tools
   - Verify room subscriptions are cleaned up

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check WebSocket connections
curl http://192.168.0.129:3000/health

# Test API endpoint
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.129:3000/api/v1/marketplace/providers/profile \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userId": "test", "profile": {"businessName": "Test"}}'
```
