## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive income tracking system for Service Providers to monitor their earnings from completed cases without the complexity of maintaining pricelists.

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema**
Created `case_income` table to store income records:

**Table Structure:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE case_income (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  case_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  provider_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  customer_id TEXT,
  amount REAL NOT NULL,
  currency TEXT DEFAULT 'BGN',
  payment_method TEXT,
  notes TEXT,
  recorded_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  updated_at TEXT NOT NULL,
  FOREIGN KEY (case_id) REFERENCES marketplace_service_cases(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (provider_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES users(id)
)
```

**Indexes for Performance:**
- `idx_case_income_provider` - Fast provider lookups
- `idx_case_income_case` - Case-based queries
- `idx_case_income_recorded_at` - Date-based filtering
- `idx_case_income_provider_date` - Combined provider + date queries
