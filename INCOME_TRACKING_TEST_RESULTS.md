## 🔍 Backend API Testing

### Test Income Recording Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `POST http://192.168.0.129:3000/api/v1/cases/:caseId/complete`

**Test with cURL:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://192.168.0.129:3000/api/v1/cases/YOUR_CASE_ID/complete \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "completionNotes": "Work completed successfully",
    "income": {
      "amount": 150.00,
      "currency": "BGN",
      "paymentMethod": "cash",
      "notes": "Partial payment"
    }
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "message": "Case completed successfully",
    "incomeRecorded": true
  }
}
```

### Test Income Statistics Endpoint

**Endpoint:** `GET http://192.168.0.129:3000/api/v1/income/provider/:providerId`

**Test with cURL:**
```bash
curl http://192.168.0.129:3000/api/v1/income/provider/YOUR_PROVIDER_ID \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "summary": {
      "totalIncome": 150.00,
      "incomeCount": 1,
      "averageIncome": 150.00,
      "currency": "BGN"
    },
    "monthlyIncome": [
      {
        "month": "2025-10",
        "total": 150.00,
        "count": 1,
        "average": 150.00
      }
    ],
    "paymentMethods": [
      {
        "method": "cash",
        "total": 150.00,
        "count": 1
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🗄️ Database Verification

### Check Income Records Directly

```bash
cd D:\newtry1\ServiceTextPro\backend
node -e "const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose(); const db = new sqlite3.Database('data/servicetext_pro.db'); db.all('SELECT * FROM case_income', (err, rows) => { console.log(JSON.stringify(rows, null, 2)); db.close(); });"
```

### Expected Fields in Records:
- `id` - UUID
- `case_id` - Reference to completed case
- `provider_id` - Service provider who earned income
- `customer_id` - Customer who paid
- `amount` - Income amount (e.g., 150.00)
- `currency` - "BGN"
- `payment_method` - "cash", "card", etc.
- `notes` - Optional notes
- `recorded_at` - Timestamp
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `updated_at` - Timestamp
